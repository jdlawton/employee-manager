  ## Description
  A Node.js based business management applicaiton with a mySQL back end. Employee Manager allows you to manage your business's departments, roles, and employees.

  ## Walkthrough Video
  NOTE: Screencastify only allows 5 min videos for the free version of the plug-in and I ran out of time due to the number of features I was demonstrating in the video, so it got broken up into two parts:
